This Python script demonstrates the process of data cleaning using Pandas.
It starts by importing messy data into a DataFrame, then handles inconsistencies such as missing values, non-numeric data, and inconsistent formats.
Key steps include converting data types, filling missing values, standardizing text entries, and cleaning numeric columns.
The script also shows how to remove redundant columns and update categorical variables for consistency.
This example provides a practical approach to preparing raw data for analysis.
